    <h2>Why am i doing this?</h2>
    
    <!-- &nbsp; is used to indent the text -->
   <ul> <li><h3>Let me tell you why:</h3></li></ul>
    <p>I promised myself that i'd land an internship by the end of my last summer dbreak. But i could not even start learning anything due to my procastination.
        <br>
        <br><style = "text-indent: 40px;"></style>
        Now here i am, another summer break and another promise to myself. The difference? My mindset. To stop pricastinating, every time i delay any of my work, i punish myself. Eg: Buying chocolates for my friends out of my money I earn through tutoring. And I reward my self whenever I complete my works on time. Eg? Buy chocolates for my self. <strong>HAHAHA </strong>You're lying if you say you didn't laugh. </p>
