      <p style="text-align: justify">
        Here is an exampple of blockquote. i have a paragraph from the aplle's
        website:
      </p>
      <blockquote style="text-align: justify" cite="https://www.apple.com/">
        Trade-in values will vary based on the condition, year, and
        configuration of your eligible trade-in device. Not all devices are
        eligible for credit. You must be at least the age of majority to be
        eligible to trade in for credit or for an Apple Gift Card. Trade-in
        value may be applied toward qualifying new device purchase, or added to
        an Apple Gift Card. Actual value awarded is based on receipt of a
        qualifying device matching the description provided when estimate was
        made. Sales tax may be assessed on full value of a new device purchase.
        In-store trade-in requires presentation of a valid photo ID (local law
        may require saving this information). Offer may not be available in all
        stores, and may vary between in-store and online trade-in. Some stores
        may have additional requirements. Apple or its trade-in partners reserve
        the right to refuse, cancel, or limit quantity of any trade-in
        transaction for any reason. More details are available from Apple’s
        trade-in partner for trade-in and recycling of eligible devices.

      <li><h3>Abbreviations</h3></li>
      <p>
        This is an example of the abbr tag, it lets users view info if they
        hover over something.
        <abbr
          title="Hey thanks for hovering over me. As you can see you can have the details of stuff as you hover over something"
          ><em>Hover me.</em></abbr
        >
      </p>
      <hr />
      <li><h3>Address</h3></li>
      <p style="text-align: justify">
        The HTML address tag defines the contact information for the
        author/owner of a document or an article. Here is an example: <br />
      </p>
      <address>
        Adarsha Prasai. <br />
        Kathmandu, Nepal. <br />
        Phone: 9808888888 <br />
        Email: adarshaprasai@gmail.com
      </address>
      <hr />
      <li><h3>Hyperlinks</h3></li>
      <p>
        With Hyperlinks users can jump from the current page to a different page
        of the same website(Relative urls) or even a different website(absolute
        urls) with just a click
      </p>
      <br />
      <li>
        <p>Here is an example of an <strong>absolute url</strong>: <br /></p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adarsha-prasai-637b49283/"
            >Click Here</a
          >
          to visit my linkedin profile. <br />
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          But there was an issue right? You wanted the link to open in a
          different window? Well for that we have the Target attribute
        </p>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adarsha-prasai-637b49283/"
            target="_blank"
            >Click Here</a
          >To visit my linkedin profile in a different window
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Here is an example of a <strong>relative url</strong>: <br /></p>
        <p>
          <a
            href="/Users/adarshaprasai/Desktop/60 Days Challenge/AllAboutHtml/Day01/Day01.html"
            >Click here</a
          >To take a look at my work from day 1.
        </p>
      </li>
      <p>
          Did you know that we can also use and image as a link? You just need to
          put an img tag inside the a tag. Here's an example: Click the image below
          to read the Windbreaker manhwa<br />
        </p>
        <a
        href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/sports/wind-breaker/list?title_no=372"
        target="_blank"
        ><img
        src="../../images/windbreaker.jpg"
        alt="windbreaker cover picture"
        style="width: 300px; height: auto" /></a
        ><br />
        <p> <li>
            
            You can also directly link to email someone using the mailto: inside the
            href attribute like this: <br />
        </li> </p>
        <a href="mailto:prasaiadarsha@gmail.com">Click here</a> to send a mail
        to Adarsha Prasai.
    </p>
    <br />
</li>


<p><li>
    You can also have a hover effect showing additional info on the link to
    the user using the title attribute
</li>  
</p>

<a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adarsha-prasai-637b49283/"
target="_blank"
title="Go to adarsha's linkedin profile"
>Click here</a
>
<p>If you hover over the link above you'll see and extra text.</p>
<li><strong>Bookmarking using links</strong></li>
<p>To boookmark using links first give an id to anything you'd like to bookmark, ther in the href attribute just write that id. For example:</p>
<p><a href="#BQ">Click here</a> to go back to block quotes</p>
<hr>
<li><h3>Images</h3></li>
<p>You can embed images in your webpage using the img tag like this:</p>
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTaMhuzmcAH_LMsGIh5UcyKBGKsX5Ry4y7MuA&s" style="width: 300px; height: auto" alt="manga image">
<p>HTML also allows animated stuff like gifs. Here is how you do it:</p>
<img src="https://media.tenor.com/9SQNOsNr3OwAAAAM/jujutsukaisen-anime.gif" alt="anime boy" style="width: 300px; height: auto; float: right;">
<li><h4>Background image</h4></li>
<p style="background-image: url('https://media.tenor.com/Dtoix7--f78AAAAM/re-zero-petelgeuse-roman%C3%A9e-conti.gif');">You can also add a background image to your webpage using the background attribute like this.It was used in older versions of HTML, like body background="bg.jpg".But modern web design flexes hard with CSS instead.You can set background images using the background-image property in CSS.Like this: body { background-image: url('bg.jpg'); }You can also control how the image behaves with background-repeat.Use no-repeat if you don't want it to tile like Minecraft blocks.
    Want the image to cover the whole screen? Use background-size: cover;.
    Wanna center it perfectly? Hit it with background-position: center;.
    Modern methods are more powerful, responsive, and way more ✨ aesthetic ✨..</p>
<hr>
<li><h3>Tables</h3></li>
<p>Tables in HTML allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns <br> You can create a basic table like this: <br></p>
<table id="table2">
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Surname</th>
        <th>Age</th>
        <th>Height</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Adarsha</td>
        <td>Prasai</td>
        <td>19</td>
        <td>181cm</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Abhinab</td>
        <td>Prasai</td>
        <td>24</td>
        <td>170cm</td>

    </tr>
</table>
