# Day 01- Learning Basic Html

## What is HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used on the frontend and gives the structure to the webpage which you can style using CSS and make interactive using JavaScript.

## Points to remember:
### 1. Header basics
 1. ‎`<header>` tag is used to define the header section of a webpage or a section.
 2. It usually contains introductory content like the website logo, title, or navigation links.
 3. You can use multiple ‎`<header>` tags on a single page (for the whole page and for individual sections or articles).
 4. The ‎`<header>` tag helps organize the structure of the page and improves accessibility.
 5. It is a semantic element, meaning it gives meaning to the content inside it for browsers and assistive technologies.
 6. The ‎`<header>` tag is different from the ‎`<head>` tag, which is used for metadata and not visible on the page.
 7. Common elements inside a ‎`<header>` are ‎`<h1>`–‎`<h6>`, ‎`<nav>`, logo images, and sometimes search forms.
 8. The ‎`<header>` tag does not add any default styling; you use CSS to style it.
